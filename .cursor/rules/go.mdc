- When creating struct tags in go, prefer to use camel case.  Do not use snake case.
- Prefer using `any` instead of `interface{}`

- Always follow the Uber Go Style Guide: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uber-go/guide/refs/heads/master/style.md

## Testing Requirements
- Tests must be updated whenever function signatures change
- All tests must pass after any code changes

## Code Quality
- All code must pass linting checks
- No unused imports or variables
- Comments should only be used when code is not obvious. Avoid comments that simply restate what the code does (e.g., "Use no-op logger for tests" or "close channel")
- Use standard library functions instead of reimplementing them (e.g., use `strings.Contains` instead of custom substring search functions)
